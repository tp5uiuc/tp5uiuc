### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm a scientific researcher and developer.
- ðŸ“– I'm pursuing my PhD at the intersection of continuum mechanics, theoretical modeling, numerical algorithms, HPC, software-at-scale and optimization/learning techniques.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [`elastica++`](https://www.cosseratrods.org/), a HPC library to simulate the dynamics of soft elastic rods.
- ðŸ¥‡ I'm also working on software that captures interaction between fluid flows and soft+rigid structures.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computational statistics, RL/ML.
